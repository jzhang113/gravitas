Gravitas is a theme commonly used for administrative websites at the University
of Iowa.

It provides some common default default styling. However, you may find that your
client would like theme changes. If that's the case, consider creating a
subtheme of gravias.

-- SUBTHEME SETUP --

Follow Adaptive Theme's subtheme instructions, also provided in the _README.txt
file, using gravitas as the basetheme instead of adaptivetheme.

@TODO: Provide specific subtheme instructions.

@TODO: Provide drush gravitas subtheme command
